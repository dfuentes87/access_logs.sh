# access_logs.sh
A quick way to check the top 5 IPs hitting a domain's access logs. Mainly designed for servers using Plesk or cPanel, but it will *try* to do it on other types. Must be ran by root or use sudo.

Bash script originally conceived by Randy Marcial, a fellow Media Temple co-worker, as an easier way for junior CS agents as well as customers to get this info in helping them troubleshoot potential issues. With permission, I added it to my Github and made some personal improvements and changes.
